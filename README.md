*Passion to create something to help make the learning process more interactive*

## Purpose
* Creates a 3D visualization for an object.

Use Look-Into-Form to teach geometry and structure of any shape, or particularly any structure.

This AR tool wants to enhance teacher's capabilities and provide possibilities to show things that cannot be shown with physical tools, or within the classroom.

## What I learned
* Uses of AR/VR in other fields.
* How to use Augmented Reality in real world.
* Different methods in which Augmented Reality can be useful to create a more advanced learning environment.

## Challenges
If the physical copy of the Hiro marker is not available, ust kept the marker tab open in laptop, and run the site using mobile phone to visualize any object.

## Limitations
* Use the marker below along with the Hiro marker on it's center to visualize the 3-D object.

* The Hiro marker (given below) alone can also be used, but there must be some while space available around the marker, so that it can be recognized.

* One can use a 3D Model based on his/her choice, but the model should be in *GLTB* format. That is, the file extension should be .glb
* While adding a different model for visualization, it should be added particularly in the "assets" folder only.
* If the project is used for visualizing different shapes, then the particular shape can be added to the code by changing the current shape, which is the cube.
